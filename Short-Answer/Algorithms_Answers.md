## Exercise I

a) O(n)
    The time complexity of this problem increases linearly in direct relation to the size of n.


b)O(nlogn)
The complexity of i is O(n), while the complexity of j is O(logn), because j is doubling every iteration (thus halving the time to reach n). Put together, that makes O(nlogn).


c)O(n)
    The complexity of this algorithm also increases linearly, in proportion with 'bunnies'.
